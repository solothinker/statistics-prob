# statistics-prob
During my academics I was afraid about _Statistics and Probability_. Now, I am working on those concepts again. In the place of _memorizing_ them, I am writing down the _codes_. Very optimized libraries are already available. No doubt about that. This work is for fun and understanding the _Principle of State and Prob_.

To develop my understanding, I am going through the [Khan Academic Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxtUt_-GyM&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566) video lectures
