Example
Ugarte and colleagues report that the average number of goals in a World Cup
soccer match is approximately 2.5 and the Poisson model is appropriate.
Because the average event rate is 2.5 goals per match, Î» = 2.5.

If electricity power failures occur according to a Poisson distribution with an
average of display 3 failures every twenty weeks, calculate the probability that
there will not be more than one failure during a particular week.
